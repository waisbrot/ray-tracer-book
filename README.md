My implementation of [_The Ray Tracer Challenge_](https://pragprog.com/titles/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge/) using Rust

I'm using VS Code as my IDE, but `cargo build` and `cargo test` also work for me on the command-line.

This is a "learn Rust" sort of project, so the code is likely low quality and the documentation is intended for me.
